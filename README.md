# Markdownlive

Markdown plugin implemention propose.

## Example

    ```live:slide
    ./images/1.png
    ./images/2.png
    ./images/3.png
    ```

What's needed is:

- A markdown plugin engine to support `live` keyword
- A plugin to drive codes in the block to a live slide

`slide` is just an example name, stands for a plugin type.
